        <h4>HTML file Explanation </h4>
        <li>We have total 7 elements on screen</li>
        <li>There are two text boxes to take input from user.
            The text boxes have labels Number 1 and Number 2 and
            The input tags for each text box has id Nnum1 and num2. 
        </li>
        <li>Next we have 4 buttons each performs an arithematic opertaion when 
            clicked.
            Each button has its own id as add, sub, mul and div.
        </li>
        <li>Lastly we have an h1 tag which shows result when we click on any of the 4 buttons.</li>
        <li>The list element is just for explanation. It's not a part of the calculator.</li>

        <h4>JS File Explanation </h4>
        <li>In order to perform any operation on an html element using JS,
            we need to store it's reference first. Or we need to refer it or we need to grab it first.  
        </li>
        <li>So for all of our 7 elements we need to store their reference in variables. 
            So for each element 2 input tags with ids num1 and num2, 4 buttons with id's add, sub, mul and div,
            we create 7 variables and store the reference of each element.
        </li>
        <li>Now what we want is that we want to show the sum, multiplication, subtraction or division of 
            two numbers whenever a respective button is clicked.
        </li>
        <li>So we use evenlistener on buttons. An event is a click, hover, a keypress etc.
            So event listener we attach to our 4 buttons will listen or wait for a click.
            When a click event occurs, The function inside the event listener will be executed.
        </li>
        <li>Let's say the user entered 2 numbers and clicked on the add button. 
            Now the event listener will execute the function inside it.
            the function for add button takes the VALUE of num1 and num2 and adds them.
            The value we get using num1.value will be in the form of a string so if we simply write num1.value+num2.value;
            it will concatenate the numbers rather than adding them. 
            So we have to use a built in function to convert string into a number or integer so that we can add them.
            That's why we;ve used parseInt(num1.value) which takes the string value and converts it into an integer. 
        </li>
        <li>Now the h1.innerText actually targets our h1 element int the html which has id ="result".
            When we click on the button let's say add, first the value of 2 numbers is converted int o integers and then we target
            the h1 element and change its inner text which we set as 'Result', and change it to the calculated sum.
        </li>
        <li>Same goes for all the other 3 buttons</li>
    </ul>
