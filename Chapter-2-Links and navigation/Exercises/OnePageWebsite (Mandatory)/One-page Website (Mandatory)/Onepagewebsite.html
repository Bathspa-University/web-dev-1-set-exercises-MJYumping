<!-- Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button. -->
